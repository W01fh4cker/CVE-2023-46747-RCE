# Q & A  
1. Q: Token acquisition failed?  
   A: It cannot be said that there must be no vulnerability in the test site, because creating a user without authorization is not 100% successful. Sometimes you do not create a user in the first step due to some reasons, so the token in the second step cannot be obtained. Therefore, my suggestion is to try a few more times. If it does not work, it may mean that there is indeed no vulnerability.
